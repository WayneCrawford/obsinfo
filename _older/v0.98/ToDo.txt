Options suggested by JM Saurel:
  - Reorganize reponse files in "PolesZeros/", "FIR/", "Coefficients/",
    "Polynomial/" directories (instead of ana_filt, dig_filt...)
    
Instruments should specify the delay applied and the obs-info code should verify
that this correction corresponds to the delay predicted from the digital filter
offets and/or stage delays
    - Set delay to 0
    - If offset is specified, calculate delay from it and input_sample_rate
    - If delay is specified, compare to calculated delay, send error if different
    - If delay is not specified, set it to the calculated value
    - Sum all of the delays
    - Compare with any provided delay value

- Simplify response files:
    - change input_sampling_interval to input_sample_rate
    - remove output_sample_rate (should be calculated from decimation_factor)
- change "response:corrected" to "response:delay_correction"

Options suggested by JM Saurel:
  - remove scaling_divisor: it should perhaps simply be expressed as "gain" and
    in any case it should be calculable from the sum of the coefficients
        - Currently state gain=1 and then use the scaling_divisor to make it so
  - Reorganize reponse files in "PolesZeros/", "FIR/", "Coefficients/",
    "Polynomial/" directories (instead of ana_filt, dig_filt...)

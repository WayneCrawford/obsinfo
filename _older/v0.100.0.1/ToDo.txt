For version 0.101:
    - Put JSON schema files with the code (so that the code can check validity)
    - Allow a generic and a specific instrument-components file (and associated
      subdirectories)
        - Could the generic one be specified in the specific one? 
        - Should the instrument_component file(s) just specify the official
          azimuth,dip values (e.g., "Z","N","E" for most seismometers), leaving
          the instrumentation file to change their azimuths and dips and/or
          change their names? (N->1, changes uncertainty to 180)? 
    - Put location code in instrumentation.yaml (allows proper specification of Hydroctopus, for example)
        - Should automatically verify that channel_locations in network.yaml correspond
        - Or only require a location code in instrumentation.yaml if there are duplicate channel codes?
    - Allow network.yaml files to specify instrument orientations
    - Should I change network/general_information to network/fdsn_information?
    - Should I be able to NOT specify the sample_rate?  (defined in data logger configuration?)
        - OR not specify configuration, but have instrumentation construct it from sample_rate (and dig_filter???)

Instruments should specify the delay applied and the obs-info code should verify
that this correction corresponds to the delay predicted from the digital filter
offets and/or stage delays
    - Set delay to 0
    - If offset is specified, calculate delay from it and input_sample_rate
    - If delay is specified, compare to calculated delay, send error if different
    - If delay is not specified, set it to the calculated value
    - Sum all of the delays
    - Compare with any provided delay value
